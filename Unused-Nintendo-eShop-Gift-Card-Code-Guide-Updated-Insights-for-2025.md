## What is a Nintendo eShop Gift Card Code?

A Nintendo eShop gift card code is a prepaid digital or physical card that contains a 16-character alphanumeric code. Once redeemed, the code adds a specific amount of funds to the user’s Nintendo eShop account, which can then be used to buy games, downloadable content (DLC), and subscriptions like Nintendo Switch Online.

### How Nintendo eShop Codes Work

Nintendo eShop gift card codes typically come in denominations like \$10, \$20, \$35, \$50, or even regional equivalents. They are region-locked, meaning a card bought in the U.S. may not work in Europe or Japan.

#### Benefits of Using eShop Gift Card Codes

* No need for a credit card
* Can be gifted easily
* Compatible with Nintendo Switch, 3DS, and Wii U
* Safe and secure transactions

##### Types of Nintendo Gift Cards

* Physical Nintendo eShop Cards (available in stores)
* Digital Nintendo eShop Codes (emailed upon purchase)
